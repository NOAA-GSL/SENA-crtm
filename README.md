# Overview

This repository contains a stand-alone kernel for the `CRTM_Doubling_layer_AD`
subroutine, extracted from the Community Radiative Transfer Model (CRTM). The 
goal of this repository is to facilitate direct comparisons of different
implementations of `CRTM_Doubling_layer_AD`. Alternative implementations may
use different programming languages, parallel programming models, or numerical
modeling libraries. They may also target different hardware such as GPUs or
ARM processors. In numerical modeling, metrics for comparison traditionally
include performance and portability. However, this work encourages comparison
of developer productivity and design metrics such as ease of use, extensibility,
and maintainability.

A Fortran 90 implementation of `CRTM_Doubling_layer_AD` is provided as a baseline
reference to which other implementations should be compared. Additionally, two
GPU versions are provided using OpenACC directives.  These GPU versions do not
alter the original code structure.  Additional implementations will be added as
they are developed.

# Contents

This repository is organized as follows.

### `test/`

Contains the reference test baselines, input and output data all implementations
must use for testing and validation.

### `ref/`

Contains the source tree for the reference implementation. See the README in that
directory for details about how to run and test it.
